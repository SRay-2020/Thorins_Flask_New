    <h2>About Page</h2>

<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

<h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
<p>In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
    Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
    2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
    Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
    point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
    the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.</p>

			<p>
				Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
				Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
				the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

<h3>Óin</h3>
<p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Oin's uncle was King Fundin, the
    father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
    Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the
    Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to
    reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company
    as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later
    settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dain Ironfoot II along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <p>
                In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying
                Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon
                Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to
                get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the
                battle, he returned to the Lonely Mountain.

<h3>Balin</h3>
<p>Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Dwarves who
    accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
    A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest friends and
    advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble house of Durin.

    He later went to re-establish the kingdom of Moria, but within five years it was overcome once more by Orcs, and he
    was killed there along with the rest of his companions

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and Gandalf
                began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. He was wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, his tucked into the belt
                and walked in as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking while
                Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his
                kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and
                Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as
                himself. Dwalin lent a green hood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out on their journey.
            
                After Thorin's Company reclaimed the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought alongside his companions in the Battle of
                Five Armies. He survived the battle, and later received his fourteenth share of Smaug's hoard. He chose to live
                afterwards in Erebor under the rule of Dáin II Ironfoot, Thorin's cousin and now King under the Mountain.

<h3>Ori</h3>
<p>Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member
    of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the
    Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in
    the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived

            <h3>Dori</h3>
            <p>
                Dori was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori,[1] travelled with Bilbo Baggins
                and Thorin Oakenshield as a member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from
                the dragon Smaug.
                Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as
                well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore
                a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the thirteen
                companions

            <p>
                Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial
                relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their
                home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as
                a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy
                maker.

<h3>Bofur</h3>
<p>While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the meeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur
    and cousin Bifur. He accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's Company across Wilderland to
    the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's demise,
    Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as
    agreed upon.

            <h3>Bombur</h3>
            <p>
                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He is the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line,
                although he was descended from the Dwarves of Moria. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA
                2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after
                Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur
                was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains
                alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

<h3>Bilbo</h3>
<p>Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in The Lord of
    the Rings.
    Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of Erebor, and
    later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One Ring, and the first to
    voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his adventures in a book he called There and
    Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo
    Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
    Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the Undying
    Lands.
